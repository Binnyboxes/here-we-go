<h2> Funny Story! </h2>

   <p> Professor Orbach,
     I was reviewing class #1 on Sunday night,
     and my wife heard your voice,
     and thought it sounded familiar.</p>
   <p> She then came over to watch the video,
     and said "That is Rabbi Orbach, Rebetzin Orbach's husband from Ba'er Miriam"! </p>
   <p> Anyway, Yael Teigman, now Yael Weiss, the twin of Chaya Teigman,
     went to Ba'er Miriam from 2013-2014, and she sends her regards!! </p>
